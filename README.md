## About The Project

As a lifelong TacoBell fan, I'm always looking to stay up-to-date on new menu items that are released. This curiosity along with trying to further my Python skills, inspired me to create the TacoBell Menu Updates Project. This is a script that scrapes the TacoBell website and appends the new data for the day to a Google Sheets dataset. The dashboard currently gives you the ability to filter to the "Current Menu" or the ability to pick a menu from a past date.
